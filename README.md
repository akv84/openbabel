Custom version of [OpenBabel](http://openbabel.org) hacked by me, I'm using this in some of
my own older scientific visualization/molecular modeling tools and libraries.

This project should indeed be private but since I will soon open-source
some projects which depend on this version of OpenBabel, I will
keep it alive until all the projects are ported to work with the
standard OpenBabel library.

Go to the official [OpenBabel website](http://openbabel.org) if you are interested in downloading the real thing.
